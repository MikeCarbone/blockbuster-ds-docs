# Installing

You can begin by installing from the NPM registry:

`npm install blockbuster-design-system`


# Using

You can then import any of the components into your design like this:
```js
import { Button, Global } from 'blockbuster-design-system`
    
export default function Home => (
    <>
        <Global />
        <Button>Click</Button>
    </>
);
```

## Styling
This design system uses CSS variables for global theming.
The variables are converted from JS to CSS in the `<Global />` component, so make sure to include it in whichever page you intend to use the components on.
Or, include it in a separate page wrapper component.
