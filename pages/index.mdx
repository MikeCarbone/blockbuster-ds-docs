# Installing

You can begin by installing from the NPM registry:

`npm install blockbuster-design-system`


# Using

You can then import any of the components into your design like this:
```js
import { Button, Global } from 'blockbuster-design-system`
    
export default function Home => (
    <>
        <Global />
        <Button>Click</Button>
    </>
);
```

## Styling
This design system uses CSS variables for global theming.
The variables are converted from JS to CSS in the `<Global />` component, so make sure to include it in whichever page you intend to use the components on.
Or, include it in a separate page wrapper component.

## Fonts
Make sure to add this Google fonts link within your project to make sure the proper fonts load with the theme.

```js
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;700&family=Roboto:wght@100;300;400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Responsive Design
The variables are designed with responsiveness in mind. Most elements, if used correctly, should be automatically responsive. For more flexibility, the `<Box>` component takes a `flex-direction` prop, where you can then pass `var(--resp-flex-directon)` in. This will have its contents in a row on screens larger than 800px, but automatically shift to column below 800px.
